# Security Policy

If you find a security vulnerability within the server, please do *not* open a
public issue. Instead, go to the [security page](https://github.com/drwhut/tabletop_club_lobby_server/security)
on GitHub and click "Report a vulnerability".

**NOTE:** When it comes to connection and rate limiting, it is assumed that the
server is running behind a configured reverse proxy. See the [README](README.md)
for more information.
